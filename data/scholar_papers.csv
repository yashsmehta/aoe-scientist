Yash Mehta,Model Based Inference of Synaptic Plasticity Rules,2024,4,Yash Mehta,Jan Funke,"Understanding learning through synaptic plasticity rules in the brain is a grand challenge for neuroscience. Here we introduce a novel computational framework for inferring plasticity rules from experimental data on neural activity trajectories and behavioral learning dynamics. Our methodology parameterizes the plasticity function to provide theoretical interpretability and facilitate gradient-based optimization. For instance, we use Taylor series expansions or multilayer perceptrons to approximate plasticity rules, and we adjust their parameters via gradient descent over entire trajectories to closely match observed neural activity and behavioral data. Notably, our approach can learn intricate rules that induce long nonlinear time-dependencies, such as those incorporating postsynaptic activity and current synaptic weights. We validate our method through simulations, accurately recovering established rules, like Oja's, as well as more complex hypothetical rules incorporating reward-modulated terms. We assess the resilience of our technique to noise and, as a tangible application, apply it to behavioral data from Drosophila during a probabilistic reward-learning experiment. Remarkably, we identify an active forgetting component of reward learning in flies that enhances the predictive accuracy of previous models. Overall, our modeling framework provides an exciting new avenue to elucidate the computational principles governing synaptic plasticity and learning in the brain."
Yash Mehta,Recent Trends in Deep Learning Based Personality Detection,2020,389,Yash Mehta,Erik Cambria,"Recently, the automatic prediction of personality traits has received a lot of attention. Specifically, personality trait prediction from multimodal data has emerged as a hot topic within the field of affective computing. In this paper, we review significant machine learning models which have been employed for personality detection, with an emphasis on deep learning-based methods. This review paper provides an overview of the most popular approaches to automated personality detection, various computational datasets, its industrial applications, and state-of-the-art machine learning models for personality detection with specific focus on multimodal approaches. Personality detection is a very broad and diverse topic: this survey only focuses on computational approaches and leaves out psychological studies on personality detection."
Yash Mehta,NAS-Bench-Suite: NAS Evaluation is (Now) Surprisingly Easy,2022,56,Yash Mehta,Frank Hutter,"The release of tabular benchmarks, such as NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, has significantly lowered the computational overhead for conducting scientific research in neural architecture search (NAS). Although they have been widely adopted and used to tune real-world NAS algorithms, these benchmarks are limited to small search spaces and focus solely on image classification. Recently, several new NAS benchmarks have been introduced that cover significantly larger search spaces over a wide range of tasks, including object detection, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, substantial differences among these NAS benchmarks have so far prevented their widespread adoption, limiting researchers to using just a few benchmarks. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of popular NAS algorithms and performance prediction methods across 25 different combinations of search spaces and datasets, finding that many conclusions drawn from a few NAS benchmarks do not generalize to other benchmarks. To help remedy this problem, we introduce NAS-Bench-Suite, a comprehensive and extensible collection of NAS benchmarks, accessible through a unified interface, created with the aim to facilitate reproducible, generalizable, and rapid NAS research. Our code is available at https://github.com/automl/naslib."

David Ha,The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery,2024,81,Chris Lu,David Ha,"One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the â€¦"
David Ha,Evolutionary optimization of model merging recipes,2024,69,Takuya Akiba,David Ha,"We present a novel application of evolutionary algorithms to automate the creation of powerful foundation models. While model merging has emerged as a promising approach for LLM development due to its cost-effectiveness, it currently relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its potential. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that overcomes this limitation by automatically discovering effective combinations of diverse open-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring extensive additional training data or compute. Our approach operates in both parameter space and data flow space, allowing for optimization beyond just the weights of the individual models. This approach even facilitates cross-domain merging, generating models like a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capabilities. Surprisingly, our Japanese Math LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even surpassing models with significantly more parameters, despite not being explicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a culturally-aware Japanese VLM generated through our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in describing Japanese culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese VLMs. This work not only contributes new state-of-the-art models back to the open-source community, but also introduces a new paradigm for automated model composition, paving the way for exploring alternative, efficient approaches to foundation model development."
David Ha,Neuroevolution of Self-Interpretable Agents,2020,139,Yujin Tang,David Ha,"Inattentional blindness is the psychological phenomenon that causes one to miss things in plain sight. It is a consequence of the selective attention in perception that lets us remain focused on important parts of our world without distraction from irrelevant details. Motivated by selective attention, we study the properties of artificial agents that perceive the world through the lens of a self-attention bottleneck. By constraining access to only a small fraction of the visual input, we show that their policies are directly interpretable in pixel space. We find neuroevolution ideal for training self-attention architectures for vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, allowing us to incorporate modules that can include discrete, non-differentiable operations which are useful for our agent. We argue that self-attention has similar properties as indirect encoding, in the sense that large implicit weight matrices are generated from a â€¦"
David Ha,Collective intelligence for deep learning: A survey of recent developments,2022,92,David Ha,Yujin Tang,"In the past decade, we have witnessed the rise of deep learning to dominate the field of artificial intelligence. Advances in artificial neural networks alongside corresponding advances in hardware accelerators with large memory capacity, together with the availability of large datasets enabled practitioners to train and deploy sophisticated neural network models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks across several fields spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. However, as these neural networks become bigger, more complex, and more widely used, fundamental problems with current deep learning models become more apparent. State-of-the-art deep learning models are known to suffer from issues that range from poor robustness, inability to adapt to novel task settings, to requiring rigid and inflexible configuration assumptions. Collective behavior, commonly â€¦"
David Ha,Modern evolution strategies for creativity: Fitting concrete images and abstract concepts,2022,46,Yingtao Tian,David Ha,"Evolutionary algorithms (ES) have been used in the digital art scene since the 1970s. A popular application of genetic algorithms is to optimize the procedural placement of vector graphic primitives to resemble a given painting. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also been proposed to generate procedural drawings, which can be optimized using gradient descent. In this work, we revisit the use of evolutionary algorithms for computational creativity. We find that modern ES algorithms, when tasked with the placement of shapes, offer large improvements in both quality and efficiency compared to traditional genetic algorithms, and even comparable to gradient-based methods. We demonstrate that ES is also well suited at optimizing the placement of shapes to fit the CLIP model, and can produce diverse, distinct geometric abstractions that are aligned with human interpretation of language."
Jan Funke,Neurotransmitter classification from electron microscopy images at synaptic sites in Drosophila melanogaster,2024,126,Nils Eckstein,Jan Funke,"High-resolution electron microscopy of nervous systems has enabled the reconstruction of synaptic connectomes. However, we do not know the synaptic sign for each connection (i.e., whether a connection is excitatory or inhibitory), which is implied by the released transmitter. We demonstrate that artificial neural networks can predict transmitter types for presynapses from electron micrographs: a network trained to predict six transmitters (acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, octopamine) achieves an accuracy of 87% for individual synapses, 94% for neurons, and 91% for known cell types across a D. melanogaster whole brain. We visualize the ultrastructural features used for prediction, discovering subtle but significant differences between transmitter phenotypes. We also analyze transmitter distributions across the brain and find that neurons that develop together largely express only one fast â€¦"
Jan Funke,Local shape descriptors for neuron segmentation,2023,57,Arlo Sheridan,Jan Funke,"We present an auxiliary learning task for the problem of neuron segmentation in electron microscopy volumes. The auxiliary task consists of the prediction of local shape descriptors (LSDs), which we combine with conventional voxel-wise direct neighbor affinities for neuron boundary detection. The shape descriptors capture local statistics about the neuron to be segmented, such as diameter, elongation, and direction. On a study comparing several existing methods across various specimen, imaging techniques, and resolutions, auxiliary learning of LSDs consistently increases segmentation accuracy of affinity-based methods over a range of metrics. Furthermore, the addition of LSDs promotes affinity-based segmentation methods to be on par with the current state of the art for neuron segmentation (flood-filling networks), while being two orders of magnitudes more efficientâ€”a critical requirement for the processing â€¦"
Jan Funke,Automated reconstruction of whole-embryo cell lineages by learning from sparse annotations,2023,27,Caroline Malin-Mayor,Jan Funke,"We present a method to automatically identify and track nuclei in time-lapse microscopy recordings of entire developing embryos. The method combines deep learning and global optimization. On a mouse dataset, it reconstructs 75.8% of cell lineages spanning 1 h, as compared to 31.8% for the competing method. Our approach improves understanding of where and when cell fate decisions are made in developing embryos, tissues, and organs."

Jan Funke,Automatic detection of synaptic partners in a whole-brain Drosophilaâ€‰electron microscopy data set,2021,135,Julia Buhmann,Jan Funke,"We develop an automatic method for synaptic partner identification in insect brains and use it to predict synaptic partners in a whole-brain electron microscopy dataset of the fruit fly. The predictions can be used to infer a connectivity graph with high accuracy, thus allowing fast identification of neural pathways. To facilitate circuit reconstruction using our results, we develop CIRCUITMAP, a user interface add-on for the circuit annotation tool CATMAID."
Frank Hutter,Accurate predictions on small data with a tabular foundation model,2025,1,Noah Hollmann,Frank Hutter,"Tabular data, spreadsheets organized in rows and columns, are ubiquitous across scientific fields, from biomedicine to particle physics to economics and climate science,. The fundamental prediction task of filling in missing values of a label column based on the rest of the columns is essential for various applications as diverse as biomedical risk models, drug discovery and materials science. Although deep learning has revolutionized learning from raw data and led to numerous high-profile success stories, â€“, gradient-boosted decision trees, , â€“ have dominated tabular data for the past 20â€‰years. Here we present the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN), a tabular foundation model that outperforms all previous methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training time. In 2.8â€‰s, TabPFN outperforms an ensemble of the strongest baselines tuned for 4â€‰h in a â€¦"
Frank Hutter,Is mamba capable of in-context learning?,2024,32,Riccardo Grazzi,Frank Hutter,"This work provides empirical evidence that Mamba, a newly proposed selective structured state space model, has similar in-context learning (ICL) capabilities as transformers. We evaluated Mamba on tasks involving simple function approximation as well as more complex natural language processing problems. Our results demonstrate that across both categories of tasks, Mamba matches the performance of transformer models for ICL. Further analysis reveals that like transformers, Mamba appears to solve ICL problems by incrementally optimizing its internal representations. Overall, our work suggests that Mamba can be an efficient alternative to transformers for ICL tasks involving longer input sequences."
Frank Hutter,The tabular foundation model TabPFN outperforms specialized time series forecasting models based on simple features,2025,1,Shi Bin Hoo,Frank Hutter,"Foundation models have become popular in forecasting due to their ability to make accurate predictions, even with minimal fine-tuning on specific datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate how the newly released regression variant of TabPFN, a general tabular foundation model, can be applied to time series forecasting. We propose a straightforward approach, TabPFN-TS, which pairs TabPFN with simple feature engineering to achieve strong forecasting performance. Despite its simplicity and with only 11M parameters, TabPFN-TS outperforms Chronos-Mini, a model of similar size, and matches or even slightly outperforms Chronos-Large, which has 65-fold more parameters. A key strength of our method lies in its reliance solely on artificial data during pre-training, avoiding the need for large training datasets and eliminating the risk of benchmark contamination."
Frank Hutter,Can fairness be automated? Guidelines and opportunities for fairness-aware AutoML,2024,21,Hilde Weerts,Frank Hutter,"The field of automated machine learning (AutoML) introduces techniques that automate parts of the development of machine learning (ML) systems, accelerating the process and reducing barriers for novices. However, decisions derived from ML models can reproduce, amplify, or even introduce unfairness in our societies, causing harm to (groups of) individuals. In response, researchers have started to propose AutoML systems that jointly optimize fairness and predictive performance to mitigate fairness-related harm. However, fairness is a complex and inherently interdisciplinary subject, and solely posing it as an optimization problem can have adverse side effects. With this work, we aim to raise awareness among developers of AutoML systems about such limitations of fairness-aware AutoML, while also calling attention to the potential of AutoML as a tool for fairness research. We present a comprehensive overview of different ways in which fairness-related harm can arise and the ensuing implications for the design of fairness-aware AutoML. We conclude that while fairness cannot be automated, fairness-aware AutoML can play an important role in the toolbox of ML practitioners. We highlight several open technical challenges for future work in this direction. Additionally, we advocate for the creation of more user-centered assistive systems designed to tackle challenges encountered in fairness work."
Frank Hutter,Large language models for automated data science: Introducing caafe for context-aware automated feature engineering,2024,59,Noah Hollmann,Frank Hutter,"As the field of automated machine learning (AutoML) advances, it becomes increasingly important to incorporate domain knowledge into these systems. We present an approach for doing so by harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we introduce Context-Aware Automated Feature Engineering (CAAFE), a feature engineering method for tabular datasets that utilizes an LLM to iteratively generate additional semantically meaningful features for tabular datasets based on the description of the dataset. The method produces both Python code for creating new features and explanations for the utility of the generated features. Despite being methodologically simple, CAAFE improves performance on 11 out of 14 datasets--boosting mean ROC AUC performance from 0.798 to 0.822 across all dataset-similar to the improvement achieved by using a random forest instead of logistic regression on our datasets. Furthermore, CAAFE is interpretable by providing a textual explanation for each generated feature. CAAFE paves the way for more extensive semi-automation in data science tasks and emphasizes the significance of context-aware solutions that can extend the scope of AutoML systems to semantic AutoML. We release our code, a simple demo and a python package."
Timothy P. Lillicrap,Androidinthewild: A large-scale dataset for android device control,2024,129,Christopher Rawles,Timothy Lillicrap,"There is a growing interest in device-control systems that can interpret human natural language instructions and execute them on a digital device by directly controlling its user interface. We present a dataset for device-control research, Android in the Wild (AitW), which is orders of magnitude larger than current datasets. The dataset contains human demonstrations of device interactions, including the screens and actions, and corresponding natural language instructions. It consists of 715k episodes spanning 30k unique instructions, four versions of Android (v10â€“13), and eight device types (Pixel 2 XL to Pixel 6) with varying screen resolutions. It contains multi-step tasks that require semantic understanding of language and visual context. This dataset poses a new challenge: actions available through the user interface must be inferred from their visual appearance, and, instead of simple UI element-based actions, the action space consists of precise gestures (eg, horizontal scrolls to operate carousel widgets). We organize our dataset to encourage robustness analysis of device-control systems, ie, how well a system performs in the presence of new task descriptions, new applications, or new platform versions. We develop two agents and report performance across the dataset. The dataset is available at https://github. com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/androidinthe_wild."
Timothy P. Lillicrap,Mastering diverse domains through world models,2023,511,Danijar Hafner,Timothy Lillicrap,"Developing a general algorithm that learns to solve tasks across a wide range of applications has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Although current reinforcement learning algorithms can be readily applied to tasks similar to what they have been developed for, configuring them for new application domains requires significant human expertise and experimentation. We present DreamerV3, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single configuration. Dreamer learns a model of the environment and improves its behavior by imagining future scenarios. Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing, and transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula. This achievement has been posed as a significant challenge in artificial intelligence that requires exploring farsighted strategies from pixels and sparse rewards in an open world. Our work allows solving challenging control problems without extensive experimentation, making reinforcement learning broadly applicable."
Timothy P. Lillicrap,Backpropagation and the brain,2020,1002,Timothy P Lillicrap,Geoffrey Hinton,"During learning, the brain modifies synapses to improve behaviour. In the cortex, synapses are embedded within multilayered networks, making it difficult to determine the effect of an individual synaptic modification on the behaviour of the system. The backpropagation algorithm solves this problem in deep artificial neural networks, but historically it has been viewed as biologically problematic. Nonetheless, recent developments in neuroscience and the successes of artificial neural networks have reinvigorated interest in whether backpropagation offers insights for understanding learning in the cortex. The backpropagation algorithm learns quickly by computing synaptic updates using feedback connections to deliver error signals. Although feedback connections are ubiquitous in the cortex, it is difficult to see how they could deliver the error signals required by strict formulations of backpropagation. Here we build on â€¦"

Some of those implementations collect experience data from multiple robots that operate simultaneously. Each robot generates instances of experience data during iterative performance of episodes that are each explorations of performing a task, and that are each guided based on the policy network and the current policy parameters for the policy network during the episode. The collected experience data is generated during the episodes and is used to train the policy network by iteratively updating policy parameters of the policy network based on a batch of collected experience data. Further, prior to performance of each of a plurality of episodes performed by the robots, the current updated policy parameters can be provided (or retrieved) for â€¦"
Timothy P. Lillicrap,A data-driven approach for learning to control computers,2022,106,Peter C Humphreys,Timothy Lillicrap,"It would be useful for machines to use computers as humans do so that they can aid us in everyday tasks. This is a setting in which there is also the potential to leverage large-scale expert demonstrations and human judgements of interactive behaviour, which are two ingredients that have driven much recent success in AI. Here we investigate the setting of computer control using keyboard and mouse, with goals specified via natural language. Instead of focusing on hand-designed curricula and specialized action spaces, we focus on developing a scalable method centered on reinforcement learning combined with behavioural priors informed by actual human-computer interactions. We achieve state-of-the-art and human-level mean performance across all tasks within the MiniWob++ benchmark, a challenging suite of computer control problems, and find strong evidence of cross-task transfer. These results demonstrate the usefulness of a unified human-agent interface when training machines to use computers. Altogether our results suggest a formula for achieving competency beyond MiniWob++ and towards controlling computers, in general, as a human would."
Pranav Rajpurkar,A clinical certification pathway for generalist medical AI systems,2025,0,Pranav Rajpurkar,Eric J Topol,"There have been extensive evaluations of artificial intelligence (AI) systems for narrow medical tasks, but more work is needed to systematically evaluate and deploy AI systems that can perform a broad range of medical tasks. The medical training process itself might offer a template for addressing this challenge. Clinicians undergo rigorous education and training, progressing through stages of increasing responsibility and autonomy. Similarly, generalist medical AI systems could be subjected to a phased certification model before they are granted greater autonomy in patient care. At the initial stage, AI systems need to show an understanding of foundational medical knowledge, akin to medical students completing their basic sciences education. Although existing AI models have already shown good performance on standardised assessments, such as the US Medical Licensing Examination Step 1, new forms of â€¦"
Pranav Rajpurkar,Multimodal image-text matching improves retrieval-based chest x-ray report generation,2024,41,Jaehwan Jeong,Pranav Rajpurkar,"Automated generation of clinically accurate radiology reports can improve patient care. Previous report generation methods that rely on image captioning models often generate incoherent and incorrect text due to their lack of relevant domain knowledge, while retrieval-based attempts frequently retrieve reports that are irrelevant to the input image. In this work, we propose Contrastive X-Ray REport Match (X-REM), a novel retrieval-based radiology report generation module that uses an image-text matching score to measure the similarity of a chest X-ray image and radiology report for report retrieval. We observe that computing the image-text matching score with a language-image model can effectively capture the fine-grained interaction between image and text that is often lost when using cosine similarity. X-REM outperforms multiple prior radiology report generation modules in terms of both natural language and clinical metrics. Human evaluation of the generated reports suggests that X-REM increased the number of zero-error reports and decreased the average error severity compared to the baseline retrieval approach. Our code is available at: https://github. com/rajpurkarlab/X-REM"

However, the readiness of these models for real-world clinical application remains inadequately tested. This paper introduces the Conversational Reasoning Assessment Framework for Testing in Medicine (CRAFT-MD) approach for evaluating clinical LLMs. Unlike traditional methods that rely on structured medical examinations, CRAFT-MD focuses on natural dialogues, using simulated artificial intelligence agents to interact with LLMs in a controlled environment. We applied CRAFT-MD to assess the diagnostic capabilities of GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mistral and LLaMA-2-7b across 12 medical specialties. Our experiments revealed critical insights into the limitations of current LLMs in terms of clinical conversational reasoning, history-taking and diagnostic accuracy. These limitations also â€¦"

The USA and China are leading in the number of trials, with a focus on deep learning systems for medical imaging, particularly in gastroenterology and radiology. A majority of trials (70 [81%] of 86) report positive primary endpoints, primarily related to diagnostic yield or performance; however, the predominance of single-centre trials, little demographic reporting, and varying reports of operational efficiency raise concerns about the generalisability and practicality of these results.

We propose a new paradigm for medical AI, which we refer to as generalist medical AI (GMAI). GMAI models will be capable of carrying out a diverse set of tasks using very little or no task-specific labelled data. Built through self-supervision on large, diverse datasets, GMAI will flexibly interpret different combinations of medical modalities, including data from imaging, electronic health records, laboratory results, genomics, graphs or medical text. Models will in turn produce expressive outputs such as free-text explanations, spoken recommendations or image annotations that demonstrate advanced medical reasoning abilities. Here we identify a set of high-impact potential applications for GMAI and lay out specific technical capabilities and training datasets necessary â€¦"
Michael F. Bonner,High-performing neural network models of visual cortex benefit from high latent dimensionality,2024,39,Eric Elmoznino,Michael F Bonner,"Geometric descriptions of deep neural networks (DNNs) have the potential to uncover core representational principles of computational models in neuroscience. Here we examined the geometry of DNN models of visual cortex by quantifying the latent dimensionality of their natural image representations. A popular view holds that optimal DNNs compress their representations onto low-dimensional subspaces to achieve invariance and robustness, which suggests that better models of visual cortex should have lower dimensional geometries. Surprisingly, we found a strong trend in the opposite directionâ€”neural networks with high-dimensional image subspaces tended to have better generalization performance when predicting cortical responses to held-out stimuli in both monkey electrophysiology and human fMRI data. Moreover, we found that high dimensionality was associated with better performance when learning new categories of stimuli, suggesting that higher dimensional representations are better suited to generalize beyond their training domains. These findings suggest a general principle whereby high-dimensional geometry confers computational benefits to DNN models of visual cortex."
Michael F.

Here we use machine learning and fMRI to test the hypothesis that object co-occurrence statistics are encoded in the human visual system and elicited by the perception of individual objects. We identified low-dimensional representations that capture the latent statistical structure of object co-occurrence in real-world scenes, and we mapped these statistical representations onto voxel-wise fMRI responses during object viewing. We found that cortical responses to single objects were predicted by the statistical ensembles in which they typically occur, and that this link between objects and their visual contexts was made most strongly in parahippocampal cortex, overlapping with the anterior portion of scene-selective parahippocampal place area. In contrast, a language-based statistical model of the co-occurrence of â€¦"
Michael F. Bonner,A sparse null code emerges in deep neural networks,2024,2,Brian S Robinson,Michael Bonner,"The internal representations of deep vision models are often assumed to encode specific image features, such as contours, textures, and object parts. However, it is possible for deep networks to learn highly abstract representations that may not be linked to any specific image feature. Here we present evidence for one such abstract representation in transformers and modern convolutional architectures that appears to serve as a null code, indicating image regions that are non-diagnostic for the object class. These null codes are both statistically and qualitatively distinct from the more commonly reported feature-related codes of vision models. Specifically, these null codes have several distinct characteristics: they are highly sparse, they have a single unique activation pattern for each network, they emerge abruptly at intermediate network depths, and they are activated in a feature-independent manner by weakly informative image regions, such as backgrounds. Together, these findings reveal a new class of highly abstract representations in deep vision models: sparse null codes that seem to indicate the absence of relevant features."
Michael F. Bonner,Perceived distance alters memory for scene boundaries,2022,18,Alon Hafri,Michael F Bonner,"Memory often fills in what is not there. A striking example of this is boundary extension, whereby observers mistakenly recall a view that extends beyond what was seen. However, not all visual memories extend in this way, which suggests that this process depends on specific scene properties. What factors determine when visual memories will include details that go beyond perceptual experience? Here, seven experiments (N = 1,100 adults) explored whether spatial scaleâ€”specifically, perceived viewing distanceâ€”drives boundary extension. We created fake miniatures by exploiting tilt shift, a photographic effect that selectively reduces perceived distance while preserving other scene properties (e.g., making a distant railway appear like a model train). Fake miniaturization increased boundary extension for otherwise identical scenes: Participants who performed a scene-memory task misremembered fake â€¦"
Michael F. Bonner,Universal dimensions of visual representation,2024,2,Zirui Chen,Michael F Bonner,"Do neural network models of vision learn brain-aligned representations because they share architectural constraints and task objectives with biological vision or because they learn universal features of natural image processing? We characterized the universality of hundreds of thousands of representational dimensions from visual neural networks with varied construction. We found that networks with varied architectures and task objectives learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite appearing highly distinct at a surface level. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with fMRI, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network's specific characteristics. Remarkably, each network can be reduced to fewer than ten of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the human brain. These results suggest that the underlying similarities between artificial and biological vision are primarily governed by a core set of universal image representations that are convergently learned by diverse systems."
