### Detailed Summary of Key Technical Points, Contributions, and Findings

The papers provided focus on **Zero-Shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**, a paradigm that aims to eliminate the need for expensive training during the architecture search process. The key idea is to design **proxies** that can predict the accuracy of neural networks without training their parameters. The papers review and compare state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot NAS approaches, emphasizing their **hardware awareness** and theoretical underpinnings.

#### Key Contributions:
1. **Review of Zero-Shot Proxies**: The papers categorize existing zero-shot proxies into **gradient-based** and **gradient-free** methods, providing theoretical insights into their design. Gradient-based proxies rely on gradients of the network parameters or activations, while gradient-free proxies use properties like the number of linear regions or topological features.
   
2. **Large-Scale Experiments**: The authors conduct extensive experiments to compare various zero-shot proxies against naive proxies like the number of parameters (#Params) and floating-point operations (#FLOPs). They reveal that many existing proxies perform poorly in constrained search settings (e.g., when considering only high-accuracy architectures).

3. **Hardware-Aware NAS**: The papers explore the application of zero-shot NAS in hardware-aware scenarios, demonstrating that some proxies correlate better with test accuracy on top-performing architectures like ResNets and MobileNets. They also highlight the limitations of existing proxies in hardware-aware settings.

4. **Future Directions**: The authors outline promising research directions, including the design of better proxies that consider **expressive capacity**, **generalization capacity**, and **trainability** simultaneously, as well as the development of more diverse and practical NAS benchmarks.

### In-Depth Analysis of Methodologies and Techniques

#### 1. **Zero-Shot Proxies**:
   - **Gradient-Based Proxies**:
     - **Gradient Norm**: Measures the sum of the â„“2-norms of gradients across layers. It reflects the trainability of the network.
     - **SNIP (Sensitivity-based Pruning)**: Combines parameter values and their gradients to measure importance.
     - **Synflow**: Maintains the sign of the SNIP proxy to avoid negative values.
     - **GraSP**: Considers both first-order and second-order derivatives (Hessian matrix) to measure parameter importance.
     - **Fisher Information**: Approximates the importance of neurons/channels using activation gradients.
     - **Jacobian Covariant**: Measures the expressivity of the network by analyzing the gradient of outputs with respect to inputs.
     - **Zen-Score**: Computes the expected gradient norm with respect to input perturbations, reflecting the network's expressivity.
     - **NTK Condition Number**: Uses the Neural Tangent Kernel to study training dynamics and generalization capacity.

   - **Gradient-Free Proxies**:
     - **Number of Linear Regions**: Estimates the expressivity of the network by counting distinct linear regions in the input space.
     - **Logdet**: Measures the diversity of linear regions using a logarithmic determinant of a matrix derived from activation patterns.
     - **Topology-Inspired Proxies (NN-Mass, NN-Degree)**: Analyze the connectivity patterns of networks (e.g., skip connections) to predict trainability and accuracy.

#### 2. **Benchmarks and Hardware Performance Models**:
   - **NAS Benchmarks**: The papers evaluate zero-shot proxies on popular benchmarks like NASBench-101, NATS-Bench, and TransNAS-Bench-101. These benchmarks provide precomputed accuracy and hardware metrics for various architectures.
   - **Hardware Performance Models**: Techniques like BRP-NAS, HELP, and NN-Meter are used to predict hardware metrics (e.g., latency, energy consumption) for neural architectures. These models are crucial for hardware-aware NAS.

#### 3. **Experimental Results**:
   - **Unconstrained Search Spaces**: In unconstrained settings, naive proxies like #Params and #FLOPs often outperform more sophisticated zero-shot proxies. This is because #Params and #FLOPs indirectly capture both expressive capacity and trainability.
   - **Constrained Search Spaces**: When focusing on top-performing architectures, most proxies (including #Params and #FLOPs) show a significant drop in correlation with test accuracy. This highlights the need for better proxies that perform well in constrained settings.
   - **Hardware-Aware NAS**: In hardware-aware scenarios, some proxies (e.g., Zen-Score, Jacobian Covariant) perform better than naive proxies, especially under tight hardware constraints.

### Synthesis of Main Arguments and Perspectives

#### Consensus:
- **Naive Proxies Are Surprisingly Effective**: In unconstrained search spaces, #Params and #FLOPs often outperform more complex zero-shot proxies. This is because they implicitly capture both expressive capacity and trainability.
- **Limitations of Existing Proxies**: Most existing proxies focus on only one aspect (e.g., trainability or expressivity) and fail to generalize well in constrained settings or hardware-aware scenarios.
- **Hardware Awareness Is Crucial**: For practical deployment, especially in edge-AI applications, hardware-aware NAS is essential. However, existing proxies struggle to maintain high correlation with test accuracy under relaxed hardware constraints.

#### Debates:
- **Effectiveness of Zero-Shot Proxies**: While some proxies (e.g., Zen-Score, Jacobian Covariant) show promise, there is no consensus on which proxy is universally effective. The performance of proxies varies significantly across datasets, tasks, and search spaces.
- **Theoretical Underpinnings**: The theoretical foundations of many proxies are still not fully understood. For example, why do gradient-based proxies like SNIP and Synflow work well in some cases but fail in others?

### Insights on Implications and Future Directions

#### Implications:
- **Efficiency Gains**: Zero-shot NAS can significantly reduce the computational cost of architecture search by eliminating the need for training. This makes NAS more accessible for resource-constrained applications.
- **Hardware-Aware Design**: The integration of hardware metrics into NAS is crucial for deploying efficient models on edge devices. However, current proxies need improvement to handle diverse hardware constraints effectively.

#### Future Directions:
1. **Better Proxy Design**: Future proxies should simultaneously consider expressive capacity, generalization capacity, and trainability. For example, combining gradient-based and gradient-free approaches could yield more robust proxies.
2. **Customized Proxies for Specific Architectures**: Proxies tailored for specific architecture families (e.g., ResNets, MobileNets) may outperform general-purpose proxies.
3. **Improved Benchmarks**: NAS benchmarks should include more diverse search spaces and hardware metrics to better reflect real-world applications.
4. **Theoretical Understanding**: A deeper theoretical understanding of why certain proxies work (or fail) is needed to guide the design of more effective proxies.
5. **Integration with Meta-Learning**: Meta-learning techniques could be used to learn proxy functions that generalize across tasks and datasets.
