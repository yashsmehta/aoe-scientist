## **Abstract**

Throughout history, the development of artifcial intelligence, especially artifcial neural networks, has been continuously infuenced by a deeper understanding of the brain. This infuence includes the development of the neocognitron, considered a precursor to convolutional neural networks. The emerging feld of NeuroAI posits that leveraging neuroscience knowledge could signifcantly advance AI by imbuing networks with enhanced capabilities. Unlike the human brain, which features a variety of morphologically and functionally distinct neurons, artifcial neural networks typically rely on a homogeneous neuron model. In the human brain, the diversity of neurons facilitates a wide range of intelligent behaviors. Given that artifcial networks aim to mimic the human brain, incorporating a diversity of neuron models could address key challenges in artifcial intelligence, such as efciency, interpretability, and memory capacity. This perspective begins by examining the basics of biological neuronal diversity and how biological neurons transmit and process information. We then explore research eforts to design novel neuron models for artifcial networks and discuss the potential benefts of neuronal diver‑ sity, including applications in several critical areas. Finally, we address the challenges and future directions for integrating neuronal diversity into artifcial networks, highlighting its potential to enrich NeuroAI.

## **Highlights**

# **Introduction**

We are experiencing the third wave of the artifcial intelli‑ gence revolution. Deep learning, represented by deep artif‑ cial neural networks, has been dominating numerous impor‑ tant research felds in the past decade [1–3]. The tale of artifcial neural networks dates back to mimicking nervous systems [4] in 1943, where McCulloch and Pitts abstracted a nervous system as a net of neurons, and each neuron was modeled with a "threshold logic" because the neuron exhib‑ its an all-or-none behavior. Then, Hebb was engaged by the connectionism idea and proposed the rule of Hebbian learn‑ ing—neurons that fre together should be wired together [5].

The Hebbian rule now still plays an important role in neural networks and computational neuroscience to this day. Later, Rosenblatt extended McCulloch and Pitts's idea to propose the Perceptron [6] that computes the inner product of the input and the Perceptron's internal parameters followed by a nonlinear activation. The Perceptron is the simplest net‑ work structure whose weights and bias are automatically learned by contrasting the outputs of the Perceptron and the target. However, the Perceptron was suggested to have an extremely limited expressive ability in Minsky and Papert's book [7], *i.e.*, the Perceptron cannot even execute the XOR logic. Hence, the research on the Perceptron, unfortunately, was dramatically slowed. Until 1980s, the designs of Hop‑ feld networks [8] and Boltzmann machines [9] greatly aided the resurgence of interest in neural networks. With the reinvention of the backpropagation algorithm [10, 11], studies of neural networks were rapidly advancing: many novel net‑ work models (LSTM [12], autoencoder [13], neocognitron [14], CNN [15]) were established, and fnally caught the imagination of the world in 2012 by the AlexNet [16]'s top performance on the ImageNet [17].

The brain is the most intelligent system we have ever known so far. Throughout history, the development of artifcial neural networks has been open to and constantly inspired by the increasingly deepened understanding of the brain [18]. Although after drawing inspiration from neu‑ roscience, artifcial neural networks would usually follow their own paths to ft the demands of real-world tasks. In the past decades, due to tens of billions of dollars invested into neuroscience such as NIH BRAIN initiative,1 a great amount of knowledge regarding the brain has been amassed, which can provide an ample source for applying principles of brain intelligence to artifcial neural networks. Therefore, our opinion is that neuroscience is still critical to the advances of artifcial neural networks, given the incomparable capabil‑ ity of the human brain and an ever-growing understanding of brain intelligence. Our opinion well aligns with the premise of an emerging interdisciplinary feld—NeuroAI [18] whose overarching goal is to catalyze the next generation of AI by endowing a network with more human-like capabilities. For the time being, although a human brain and an artifcial neural network serve fundamentally diferent purposes, it is crystal clear that the existing artifcial network still goes far behind our human brain from the following engineering perspectives:

#### **Efciency**

With the advent of big models, the size of a neural network becomes increasingly larger. To train such a model to a practical point, well-curated big data and considerable power need to be supplied [19]. For example, the well-performing language model GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, and its training requires hundreds of GPUs running a few months on 45 TB text data [20]. In contrast, a human brain per‑ forms its incredible feat by managing billions of neurons and coordinating trillions of connections at extremely low power (<presumably 20W) [21]. This gap is because our brain is an efcient concept learner that can learn complex objects from just a few examples [22]. The efciency issue gains more and more traction in the background of combat‑ ing global warming and carbon neutrality [23], as the AI models, particularly big language models are widely recog‑ nized as a signifcant carbon emitter [24]. Environmentalists have raised the criticism that oftentimes, the exhaustive trialand-error fne-tuning only leads to little performance gain. According to the carbon footprint computation, the training of the BERT model has a carbon footprint close to a person's one round-trip trans-America fight.2

#### **Interpretability**

A neural network is notoriously a black box [25]. Although a network performs quite well in real-world tasks, it is hard to explain the underlying mechanism. Questions are often asked what is the function of certain neurons, layers, blocks, etc. and how they impact the model's decision-making. However, only limited success is achieved for these ques‑ tions. Interpretability studies are divided into two branches [25]: post hoc interpretation and ad hoc interpretable mod‑ eling. It was argued that post hoc interpretation cannot be completely faithful to the original model because if it can be, it becomes the original model [26]. What's worse is one can hardly know the nuance between the post hoc interpreta‑ tion and the original model. But ad hoc interpretable mod‑ eling may sufer from model expressibility in accomplishing transparency. As opposed to deep models, the decision pro‑ cess in the human is highly tractable. Modern neuroscience attributes conscious acts to electrical and chemical changes within and across neurons. Visualization of working regions and neurons spatially and temporally can also be carried out well by modern brain imaging techniques such as fMRI [27].

#### **Memory**

Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue of connectionist models [28, 29], *i.e*., artifcial neural networks are incapa‑ ble of learning new information without forgetting what is

<sup>2</sup> https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/06/239031/training-a single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-fve-cars-in-their-lifet imes/

previously learned. When a network is trained to learn con‑ secutive tasks, what was learned from the previous task is easy to be interrupted by what is learned from the current task. This is because the weights trained for the earlier task have to be changed to meet the objective of the new task. The existing solutions to overcome catastrophic forgetting either require explicit retraining using the old data (so-called interleaved learning [30]) or only show efcacy in a specifc type of memory or network structures [31]. Compared to the artifcial network, our human brain has evolved efec‑ tive mechanisms to avoid catastrophic forgetting [32], *e.g*., sleeping [33] can consolidate the outcome of the awakestate learning. Although these mechanisms remain to be completely understood, more and more experiments on the neuronal level showed that sleeping facilitates the potential of target neurons to be evoked [34, 35].

#### **Robustness**

Lacking robustness is another Achilles' heel of a neural network [36]. It was often reported that a neural network is easy to trick [37]. Sometimes, adding noise that is indis‑ cernible to a human can completely change a network's prediction [38]. Later, it was shown that a neural network can be severely interfered with by common perturbation [39], such as occlusion, blur in an image, etc. Due to the widespread deployment of AI models in mission-critical scenarios, the robustness issue of neural networks has received lots of attention. Compared to a neural network, humans usually won't get confused despite small changes such as mask, shift, distortion, natural corruptions, and styl‑ ish changes in an image.

To promote neural networks to a higher level of intel‑ ligence, based on NeuroAI, we believe that at present an actionable way is to explicitly identify the diferences between brain and artifcial neural networks and then make eforts to mitigate these diferences. Clearly, the current mainstream neural network models are remarkedly difer‑ ent from the biological neural system, and one primary distinction is that neural networks lack the neuronal diver‑ sity that is everywhere in the human brain [40]. Diferent from artifcial networks that are built on a single universal primitive neuron type, the brain has numerous morpho‑ logically and functionally diferent neurons [41]. With no exaggeration, neuronal diversity is an enabling factor for all kinds of intelligent behaviors [42]. More and more works showed the biological efect of neuronal diversity. Padmanabhan and Urban examined the outputs from a sin‑ gle type of neuron and the mitral cells of the mouse olfac‑ tory bulb, and found that diverse populations were able to code for twofold more information than their homogeneous counterparts using this intrinsic heterogeneity [43]. Since the artifcial neural network is a miniature of the biological neural network, introducing neuronal diversity should be able to shed light on the aforementioned problems of the artifcial neural network.

# **Biological neuronal diversity**

The extraordinary neuronal diversity originates from neuron diferentiation [44], a complicated process to obtain difer‑ ent types of neurons that motivates many molecular signals to drive electrophysiological, morphological, and transcrip‑ tional changes in a neuron. Neuronal diversity is refected by diferent molecular, morphological, physiological, con‑ nectional features [41], and so on. Here, we briefy intro‑ duce morphological and functional diversity: the former is the most obvious diversity, and the latter is instrumental to understanding diferent functionalities of a brain.

#### **Morphological diversity**

As a defning characteristic of neuronal types, morphologi‑ cal diversity, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, includes diversity in projection patterns, bifurcation patterns, the density of branches, etc. According to the structural diferences found in microscopy, neuroscientists previously have roughly divided neurons into four categories: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudo-polar. Unipolar and pseudo-polar neurons have only one neurite extending from the soma, while that of a pseudo-polar neuron will soon split into two branches with a T-shaped structure directing to peripheral receptors and central spinal cords, respectively. While bipo‑ lar neurons extend protrusions from each end of the soma and evolve into dendrites and axons, respectively, multipolar neurons have one axon and several dendrites, which are the most common neuron type, constituting many complex cen‑ tral neural networks. Furthermore, more precise morphology studies reveal more concrete diversity from morphometry features to projection patterns on the regional level [41, 45].

#### **Functional diversity**

Functional diversity can be seen at structural, neuronal, sys‑ tematic, and behavioral levels. Neuronal functional diversity is a natural result of evolution in order to conduct complex behaviors in human life. Let us take three basic functions as examples to explain.

A human has fve basic senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing, along with other senses including balance, proprioception, interior space emotion, time spiciness, etc. Hence, there exist sensory receptors that can specifcally translate stimuli of diferent forms such as temperature, light, force, and sound, and then transmit impulses to the central nervous system. Once a sensory stimulus is applied to the exposed body part where the dendrite of the corre‑ sponding receptor neuron exists, the signal cascade and active signal pathway will be transferred, respectively. Then the functional sensory neural network starts to work. For example, as the human nose smells the fower, the olfactory sensory neurons located in the olfactory mucosa will be fred and evoke the olfactory network. Then a series of reactive events will happen.

Brain regions are often tied with functionalities. There are multiple brain regions whose neurons are involved in motion. Those motor neurons usually correspond to certain muscles. The more agile the body parts are, the more deli‑ cate the movement is, and the bigger will the corresponding neuron population grow to. Despite the target diversity, neu‑ rons from diferent motor regions also difer in function with regard to the process and degree of motion. For example, neurons in the primary motor area will lead to the simple movement of body muscles on the opposite side after the stimulus. The premotor area related to the gross shrinkage of muscle is all over the body, responsible for some aspects of motor control such as movement preparation, sensory instruction, or direct control of certain movements. The supplementary motor area serves a number of motor sug‑ gestion functions including internally generated motor plan‑ ning, sequence planning of movements, and coordination of both sides of the body. More subtle mechanisms of delicate motor have been studied in a long term with technique on diferent levels [46].

The GPS system in our brain is attributed to place neu‑ rons, grid neurons, direction neurons, boundary neurons, speed neurons, etc. These neurons coordinate together so that our brain knows where we are, where we are heading, and how far we move. When entering a particular place, a place neuron [47] is fred. However, place neurons alone cannot explain how a human navigates the environment. A coordinate system is established after grid neurons [48] are respectively activated, as one traverses a set of small regions. These roughly equal regions are arranged in a periodic array to cover the entire open environment. Together with bound‑ ary neurons [49] encoding the space borderline, a mental map of the physical world is built, which allows for global precise positioning. In addition, neurons such as direction neurons [50], speed neurons [51], and angular head velocity neurons [52] inform the brain of characters of the motion in the environment and help modulate it. For example, when one makes a turn at a corner of a street, the direction neuron is fred to monitor the direction of movement. If one is in a hurry to arrive at the destination, the speed neuron is acti‑ vated to supply the speed information.

The functional diversity of neurons is everywhere in the brain. In fact, a basic observation regarding the brain is that all complicated intelligence behaviors are a consequence of motivating diferent types of neurons. For example, diferent navigation neurons collaborate complementarily to realize all necessary functionalities for navigation.

# **Characteristics of bilogical neurons**

Per the premise of NeuroAI, one should retrospect how the information is transmitted and processed throughout a bio‑ logical neuron [53] before introducing new neurons into arti‑ fcial networks. To endow a network with more human-like capabilities, the neural mechanism should frst be discussed. Roughly, it is divided into three steps: signal transduction (inbound), compartmentalized dendritic computation, and signal transduction (outbound). Our retrospection is centered around the macroscopic mechanisms and hallmarks relevant to neural computation. Unless necessary, we will not go into the level of cellular molecular biochemistry.

#### **Signal Transduction (Inbound)**

Neurons can transduce almost all types of physical signals into electrical signals, *e.g*., optical [54, 55], mechanical [56], biochemical [57]. Within the biological neural network, the most common is biochemical signal transduction. This trans‑ duction of a neuron is carried out by two categories of trans‑ ducers of the current neuron: Membrane receptor-mediated type and nuclear receptor-mediated type. Two classic sub‑ categories of the former are ligand-gated ion channels and transmembrane G-protein coupling receptors. The former [58] will open to allow the ion fux via a conformational change when the receptor binds a chemical messenger such as neurotransmitters; the latter [59] will bind with neuro‑ transmitters and activate coupling G proteins on the mem‑ brane, which either directly causes the ion channel to open via protein–protein interaction or activates the enzyme that expedites the synthesis of the intracellular second messenger towards a lagged [60], cascaded [61], and longer-lasting [62] modulation3 to ion channels. Finally, an electrical signal will be stimulated and further processed.

#### **Dendritic computation**

In the early days, dendritic trees were believed to solely receive and transport information to the axon (passive). The pioneer of modern neuroscience once asked "Why do den‑ dritic trees even exist" [63]? However, with the progress of sharp electrodes [64], ever-growing evidence suggests that the dendritic branches are compartmentalized func‑ tional units (active). They play a fundamental role in many key computations such as coincidence detection, detection of motion direction, and storage of multiple input features (Chapter 15, [65]). Thus, a dendritic branch is a compart‑ mentalized computation unit enabled and defned by the pas‑ sive and active properties. The integrated dendritic com‑ putation, therefore, is more complicated and needs better understanding.

#### **Passive properties**

Due to the intrinsic resistance, the most salient passive property of dendrites is its attenuation efect whose role is to keep the signal local and sparse. The attenuation rate decreases with the diameter and increases with the length [66, 67]. A branchpoint, which is a bifurcation between the apical trunk and oblique dendrite, also serves as a strong attenuator to restrict the active signal transmission. In addi‑ tion to the attenuation efect, dendritic morphology can

<sup>3</sup> https://openbooks.lib.msu.edu/neuroscience/chapter/neurotransmit‑ ter-action-g-protein-coupled-receptors/

afect the fring rate and fring pattern as well [68, 69]. Fur‑ thermore, the signal propagates into distal dendritic arbors more readily than towards the soma (Chapter 14, [65]). Such an asymmetry can empower the neuron with the ability to infer the direction of motion based on the activation order of the somatic response. Finally, the dendritic structure is shown to facilitate the sparse coding in biological networks [70] that are associated with energy efciency [71], feature discrimination [72], and memory capacity [73].

#### **Active properties**

A dendrite is embedded with a variety of ionic channels that enable powerful signal processing abilities and assist the information transmission intracellularly.

- i) Voltage-gated channels are nonlinear functional devices. For example, no action potential is generated when the input current is below a certain threshold. When the input current exceeds the action potential threshold, plenty of ion channels will open and generate an abrupt change in membrane potential. The action potential cancels the attenuation efect of the morphology and ensures the reliable propagation of the signal [74]. The dendritic spikes can exhibit complicated input–output relations other than the all-or-none relation. Recently, Gidon et al. [75] showed that the human layer 2/3 corti‑ cal neurons produce maximal activation when a stimulus is close to zero, and the activation is dampened when the stimulus gets stronger. Interaction between ion channels adds another layer of nonlinearity, *e.g*., calcium-depend‑ ent potassium channels [76] link potassium channels with calcium channels, which realizes a more precise regulation for neuronal excitability.
- ii) Voltage-gated channels are highly discriminatory, which enhances the dendrites' computation power. Typically, voltage-gated channels are only open to one kind of ions over another. As such, those channels are named after the most easily passed ions. Furthermore, for the same type of ion channels, there exist a variety of subtypes that difer in their voltage dependence, kinetics, singlechannel conductance, and so on. Diferent ion channels present diferent fring patterns [74].
- iii) Active dendrites respond in a location-dependent and time-dependent manner, implicating their spatiotempo‑ ral processing ability [77, 78]. For example, dendritic sodium spikes are propagatable throughout the dendritic tree [79], while the distal apical trunk tends to initialize calcium spikes that can only spread to the apical den‑ dritic tree [80, 81]. In addition, both sodium and potas‑ sium spikes participate in coincidence detection [79, 82, 83]. For example, the potassium spike was activated

when distal and proximal dendritic regions of cortical neurons are synchronously activated [83].

#### **Signal transduction (Outbound)**

Transmitting information from a neuron's interior to its exte‑ rior has two fundamentally diferent modes. One is the direct electrical transfer via a specialized interconnected connec‑ tion called the gap junction [84]. The transfer through gap junctions is very fast. The other mode is chemical transfer via synapses, *i.e*., the presynaptic neuron releases the socalled neurohormone [85] or neurotransmitter [86] that will difuse to the target neuron. The chemical transfer converts the electrical signal into the chemical release.

- i) The chemical transfer can exert diferent efects, depend‑ ing on the types of released neurotransmitters [87]: The excitatory neurotransmitters fre the target neuron, while the inhibitory ones inhibit the target neuron, and modu‑ latory neurotransmitters afect the efects of other chemi‑ cal messengers. In most situations, one synapse can only be either excitatory or inhibitory.
- ii) The chemical transfer is subjected to random noise [74]. Even when the action potential is absent, a small depo‑ larization is recorded in the target neuron due to the spontaneous random release of a small number of neu‑ rotransmitters from the presynaptic terminal.
- iii) The relation between the level of action potentials and the amount of the released neurotransmitter is nonlinear. When the voltage is low, only a few calcium channels are open. The high calcium concentration is achieved near those open channels, thereby only facilitating the fusion of nearby vesicles. When the voltage slightly increases, more channels open; therefore, a relatively small and uniform calcium concentration emerges. But the calcium level may not be sufciently high to trigger subsequent processes [88].

Overall, despite the complicated information processing of a biological neuron, several salient characteristics should be noted: i) nonlinearity ubiquitously exists in every stage of information processing, not just in membrane channels; ii) a dendrite not only serves information transmission but also serve as compartmentalized computation unit; iii) neurons have the spatiotemporal information ability.

Figure 3 shows what kinds of computational proper‑ ties of biological neurons remain unseen in the current mainstream artifcial neurons. We divide the operations of artifcial neurons into two stages: feature aggregation and nonlinear activation. It is widely believed that the nonlinear activation function in artifcial neurons corresponds to the voltage/ligand-gated channels of biological neurons. How‑ ever, in biological neurons, except for the outbound signal

![](_page_6_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Fig. 3** A schematic representation illustrating the computational properties of biological neurons that remain largely unseen in current main‑ stream artifcial neurons. We categorize the operations of artifcial neurons into two stages: feature aggregation and nonlinear activation. In biological neurons, in addition to outbound signal transduction, voltage and ligand-gated channels facilitate information transmission and pro‑ cessing intracellularly, rather than emitting information extracellularly. The outbound signal transduction of biological neurons corresponds to the nonlinear activation of artifcial neurons, while the inbound signal transduction and dendritic computations collectively resemble the feature aggregation performed by artifcial neurons

transduction, the roles of voltage/ligand-gated channels are to assist the information transmission and processing intracellularly, instead of emitting information extra-cellularly. Therefore, we think that the outbound signal transduction of biological neurons corresponds to the nonlinear activation of artifcial neurons, while the inbound signal transduction and dendritic computation together are in analogy to the feature aggregation of artifcial neurons.

# **Neuronal diversity in artifcial neural networks**

In this section, we classify the studies of introducing neu‑ ronal diversity into four categories: activation design, poly‑ nomial neurons, dendritic neurons, and spiking neurons. Note that complex-valued neurons [89, 90] are not included because its idea is based on the need of addressing complexvalued data.

#### **Activation design**

Nowadays, the mainstream neuron type computes the inner product between the input and the connectivity parameters of upper neurons followed by a nonlinear activation func‑ tion, which is mathematically formulated as

$$\sigma(x^{\top}w+b),\tag{1}$$

where *x* is the input, *w, b* are parameters, and *σ* is the activa‑ tion function. Past years have witnessed a plethora of novel activation functions being designed [91]. Three diferent properties are often considered in developing a novel acti‑ vation function: i) As mentioned earlier, an activation func‑ tion should be nonlinear, which is a necessity to guarantee a network has a sufcient discrimination ability. Nonlinearity is also bioplausible, *i.e*., the outbound signal transduction in a biological neuron is nonlinear. ii) An activation function should allow a normal gradient fow across layers when a network is deep, *i.e*., no gradient vanishment and explosion. iii) It should facilitate information transmission to expedite the extraction of useful features from data. Table 1 sum‑ marizes several representative activation function designs. Now, we illustrate them in detail.

#### **Logistic sigmoid/tanh**

The logistic sigmoid [92] was extensively used in the early stage of neural networks. However, its employment in a deep network sufers gradient vanishment and poor convergence. The gradient is killed when the pre-activation value is super high or low, while the non-zero-centered nature forces the convergence trajectory to go zig-zag [91]. Tanh is of zerocentric nature, but its computational complexity is high, and still subjected to the gradient issue. Several variants of Tanh were proposed to enlarge the range of output function [15] and overcome the gradient vanishment problem [93, 94, 106].

#### **Rectifed linear unit (ReLU)**

ReLU [96] is currently the most popular activation function thanks to its excellent scalability. However, some research‑ ers argued that ReLU causes the loss of useful information in negative parts. To address this issue, several variants that allow the passage of negative parts were proposed such as Leaky-ReLU [95], Concatenate-ReLU [97], GenLU [98], Randomly Translational ReLU [99], ELU [100]. Besides, ReLU was believed to have a limited discriminative ability because it just assumes a linear relation in the positive range. Therefore, several variants were proposed to modify ReLU towards an enhanced non-linearity such as SReLU [101] and Natural Logarithm ReLU [102].

Radial Basis Function (RBF): A radial basis function acti‑ vation is usually used in the radial basis function network [103], which is formulated as

$$\psi(x)=\sum_{i}^{N}a_{i}\rho(||x-c_{i}||),\tag{2}$$

where *𝜌* is often taken as a Gaussian function *𝜌* ( ||*x* − *ci* ||) = exp(−*𝛽i* ||*x* − *ci* ||2 ). The radial basis func‑ tion network can be regarded as a fuzzy logic system such as the Takagi–Sugeno rule system [107] whose rule is of the format: "if x ∈ set *A* and y ∈ set *B*, then *z*=*f* (*x, y*)" [108].

#### **Bioplausible activation**

One notable class of activation functions are biologicallyinspired. Georgescu et al*.* [104] proposed a bioplausible activation function by mathematically modeling the newlydiscovered action potential pattern in a study [75] published in Science. Bhumbra [105] introduced a bionodal root activation based on the input–output relation acquired from physiologi‑ cal measurement. Electrophysiological recordings show that only a moderate increment in inputs is required to drive an action potential for some neurons [105]. Then, after an ini‑ tial linear relation, the input–output curve partially saturates because the voltage-gated channels become less sensitive.

#### **Noisy activation**

The idea of noisy activation is to inject noise into the acti‑ vation function when it is saturated. Such an injection can make gradients fow easily [106].

#### **Polynomial neuron**

Compared to the activation function, altering feature aggre‑ gation is much less explored. Per our earlier analysis, the nonlinearity in biological neurons is embedded not only in the outbound signal transduction but also in the inbound signal transduction and dendritic computation. But the inner product is a linear operation, which does not align with non‑ linearity of the inbound signal transduction and dendritic computation. The use of polynomial neurons is to endow an artifcial neuron with the nonlinear feature processing ability in the aggregation phase to better ft strongly nonlin‑ ear information. The story of polynomial neurons originates from the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH [109]), which takes a high-order polynomial as a feature extractor:

$$Y\big{(}x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{n}\big{)}=\sum_{i}^{n}a_{i}x_{i}+\sum_{i}^{n}\sum_{j}^{n}a_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}+\sum_{i}^{n}\sum_{j}^{n}\sum_{k}^{n}a_{ijk}x_{i}x_{j}x_{k}+\cdots,\tag{3}$$

where *xi* is the *i*-th input, and *ai , aij, aijk* are coefcients for interaction terms. Usually, only quadratic terms are retained in this model to avoid nonlinear explosion for high-dimen‑ sional inputs. Furthermore, with GMDH, the so-called higher-order unit was defned in [110–112] which is math‑ ematically formulated as

$$y=\sigma(Y(x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{n})),\tag{4}$$

where *𝜎*(⋅) is a nonlinear activation function. To achieve a balance between maintaining the power of high-order units and parameter efciency, Milenkoiv et al*.* [113] only utilized linear and quadratic terms and proposed to use an annealing technique to fnd optimal parameters.

Recently, high-order, particularly quadratic units were revisited [114–122]. In the work by Chrysos et al*.* [119], the complexity of higher-order units as described by Eq. (5) were greatly reduced via tensor decomposition and factor sharing; therefore, they scaled polynomial networks into a very deep paradigm to achieve the cutting-edge perfor‑ mance on several tasks. In [114, 123, 124], a quadratic convolutional flter of the complexity *O*(*n*2) was proposed to replace the linear flter. In [116], a parabolic neuron: *𝜎* ((*xTw*1 + *b*1 )(*xTw*2 + *b*2 )) was proposed for deep learning, while in [125], ( (*x ⊙ x*) *Tw* ) was proposed. Fan et al. [126]*.* proposed a simplifed quadratic neuron with *O*(3*n*) param‑ eters: ( ( *xTw*1 + *b*1 )(*xTw*2 + *b*2 ) + (*x ⊙ x*) *Tw*3) and further argued that higher-order neurons are not necessary because the fundamental theorem of algebra suggests that any poly‑ nomial can be factorized into a product of linear and quad‑ ratic terms [127]. Neuron designs in [116, 125] are special cases of that in [126]. Bu et al*.* [128] utilized the quadratic neuron, which is equivalent to [116] when combining *xTw*3 into*𝜎* ((*xTw*1 )(*xTw*2 )). Xu et al*.*'s design [118] is the same as [128]. Liu and Wang [129] defned the so-called Gang neuron, which is essentially a polynomial neuron under a particular tensor decomposition.

**Fig. 4** Three exemplary new types of neuron designs: polynomial neurons, dendritic neurons, and spiking neurons. Polynomial neurons, den‑ dritic neurons, and spiking neurons conform to the three salient characteristics of biological neurons A) ubiquitous nonlinearity in information processing; B) the active dendrite;C) the spatiotemporal information ability, respectively

#### **Dendritic neuron**

The current mainstream neuron type is a point neuron which computes a single weighted sum of all synapses. Such modeling actually ignores the active computation of the dendritic fbers and only takes them as a passive transmission medium. How‑ ever, as aforementioned, dendrites are active and serve as com‑ partmentalized information processing units to assist a neuron to perform diferent kinds of tasks. Thus, *can we go from a linear and passive neuron (point neuron) to a nonlinear and active neuron with extensive dendrite branching and extra nonlinear computation?* (Chapter 14, [65]). Along this direction, a feasible design is to frst compute a subset of nonlinear terms within a subset of computational units, then combine the responses of these units and nonlinearly map their total response (Chapter 16, [65]), as shown in Fig. 4. For example, dendritic branches were simulated to compute the sum of products (pi-sigma units [130, 131]) and to implement Boolean logic networks [132–134]. Shin et al. reported the so-called pi-sigma unit [135],

$$h=\sum_{k}w_{kjji}x_{k}+\theta_{ji},\text{and}y_{i}=\sigma\Big{(}\prod_{j}h_{ji}\Big{)},\tag{5}$$

where *hji* is the output of the *j*-th sigma unit for the *i*-th output element *yi*, and *wkji* is the weight of the *j*-th sigma unit associated with the input element *xk*. The cluster-sen‑ sitive phenomenon was discovered that given a fxed num‑ ber of synaptic inputs, concentrating the activated synapses of intermediate size can lead to the largest post-synaptic response [136–138]. Based on this phenomenon, the "clus‑ teron" was proposed in [136] whose output is given by

$$y=g(\sum_{i}^{N}a_{i}),\tag{6}$$

where *ai* = *wi xi* ( ∑ *j*∈*Di wj xj* ) is the net excitatory input at syn‑ apse *i*, and *Di* = {*i* − *r*, *i* − *r* + 1, ⋯ , *i*, ⋯ , *i* + *r* − 1, *i* + *r*} is a set of neighbors of the synapse *i*. It can be seen that the clusteron is a constrained sigma-pi unit with products of neighboring synapses. Furthermore, Jadi et al. [139] pro‑ posed a two-stage dendritic neuron:

$y=FI(\sum_{j}W_{j}d_{j})$,

where *FI* is an experimentally-determined frequency-current relation, and *dj* = *𝜎*( ∑ *i wijxi* ). However, such a dendritic neu‑ ron is essentially isomorphic to a two-layer network. Hawk‑ ins and Ahmad [140] and Grewal et al*.* [141] developed a type of dendritic neurons, as shown in Fig. 4, where each dendritic branch contains multiple synapses such that each branch can detect multiple input patterns. At the same time, Grewal et al*.* showed that such a type of dendritic neurons can alleviate catastrophic forgetting. In the aspect of hard‑ ware, Li et al. [142] experimentally demonstrated that neural networks with artifcial dendrites are power-efcient.

#### **Spiking neuron**

The current mainstream neuron types are regarded as the second-generation neurons that can only process static amplitude information. The neurons that have the spati‑ otemporal information ability are referred to as the thirdgeneration neurons, which are primarily of the "integrateand-fre" type [143–145] via spikes [146].

For example, the leaky integrator neuron is shown in Fig. 4. Its neuronal dynamics consists of two parts: (i) an equation that describes the change of the transmemebrane potential diference; (ii) a mechanism to generate a spike. We use the law of current conservation to derive the inte‑ gration equation of spiking neurons. The current is split into two components:

$$I_{t}=I_{R}+I_{C}=\frac{\Delta u_{t}}{R}+C\frac{d}{dt}\Delta u_{t},\tag{8}$$

where Δ*ut* is the transmembrane potential diference, *It* is the current from synapses or the external injection independent of the membrane potential, *R* is the leaky resistance, and *C* is the membrane capacitance. When Δ*ut* hits a threshold, it forms a spike and then set to zero. Assuming a constant external current injection and no synaptic current, we have the following:

$$\Delta u_{t}=\mbox{\it IR}(1-e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}).\tag{9}$$

Next, the mechanism of generating a spike is via a spike response model [147], which simulates the refractory prop‑ erties of a neuron because the membrane potential depends on the time of the last spike. There are other variants of the integrate-and-fre model: the linear integrate-and-fre neuron [148] which replaces Δut ∕*R* in Eq. (8) with a constant term; the quadratic integrate-and-fre neuron [149–151] which adds a quadratic term *u*2 to the right side of Eq. (8); the exponential integrate-and-fre neuron [152] which adds an exponential term regarding *ut* to the right side of Eq. (8). As mentioned earlier, the information transmission in a neuron is coupled with noise. For example, the voltage-gated chan‑ nels randomly open and close, and the vesicles randomly fuse with a neuron's membrane to release neurotransmit‑ ters. Thus, a difusion variant of spiking neurons [153, 154] was established by incorporating the stochastic nature of the current:

$$I_{t}=\mu+\sqrt{2RC\xi_{t}}=\frac{\Delta u_{t}}{R}+C\frac{d}{dt}\Delta u_{t},\tag{10}$$

where *µ* is the average synaptic current, and *𝜉t* is a Gaussian noise.

The second-generation neurons are trained with gradi‑ ent descent, whereas the training of spiking neurons is dif‑ fcult due to the non-diferentiability. Trainability has been a major bottleneck in the development of spiking networks. Now there are roughly three approaches to train a spiking network.

The idea of conversion-based methods is to map a wellperforming conventional network into a spiking network, which requires parameter recalibration and activation res‑ caling [155–157]. This method helps a spiking network to showcase the state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet. However, such a conversion may be unfaithful when time steps are low.

The second method is to employ surrogate gradients [158–160]. The spiking network is hard to train because spiking neurons fre discrete spikes that are non-difer‑ entiable. To solve this problem, diferentiable activation functions are employed as surrogates. Moreover, unroll‑ ing a spiking neuron in a discrete, recursive form perfectly corresponds to a recurrent neural network. As a result, the training of a spiking network can be done via backpropa‑ gation through time (BPTT) [161]. The caveat of surro‑ gate gradient methods is the high computation overhead given a large time step. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) approaches [162–164] gain great interest recently. SDTP methods are with local learning, following the Heb‑ bian learning rule and updating weights in an unsupervised manner. However, STDP methods are hard to scale to mul‑ tilayer spiking networks, and have limited performance on large-scale datasets.

#### **Remarks**

Polynomial neurons, dendritic neurons, and spiking neurons conform to the three salient characteristics of biological neu‑ rons: i) ubiquitous nonlinearity in information processing; ii) the active dendrite; iii) the spatiotemporal information abil‑ ity, respectively. But polynomial neurons, dendritic neurons, and spiking neurons are not exactly the same as the ways of biological neurons. We argue that artifcial networks should draw inspiration instead of copying from neuroscience. In other words, designing new neurons should prioritize the need for real-world problems instead of blindly imitating biological neurons.

## **Potential gains**

So far, we have discussed new types of neurons, with the motivation of flling the gap between the current mainstream neuron type and the real-world biological neuron. Next, more importantly, what can we gain from these new neu‑ rons? *i.e*., how can neuronal diversity truly bring benefts to the aforementioned critical issues in artifcial networks? In the following, let us illustrate the potential gains of incorpo‑ rating neuronal diversity into artifcial networks.

#### **Efciency**

In the information world, most learning tasks establish a nonlinear mapping. Intuitively, it is more efcient to incor‑ porate a nonlinear computation unit to learn a nonlinear function. Although the existing mainstream neurons can do the universal approximation when connected to a network, it is computationally heavy to use mainstream neurons to represent other neuron types because such a representation needs far more neurons, compared to directly adopting other neuron types in building a model. It was proved that there exists a class of functions that can be approximated by a heterogeneous network made of both quadratic and conven‑ tional neurons with a polynomial number of neurons, but is hard to approximate by a purely conventional or quad‑ ratic network unless an exponential number of neurons are used [165]. Moreover, regarding the training cost, using the homogeneous type of neurons takes the extra learning cost to wire neurons specifcally and orchestrate the learning pro‑ cess relative to using diferent neurons beforehand. In other words, involving neuronal diversity in artifcial networks is an embodiment of modularization at the neuronal level. The development of modern industry has confrmed the superi‑ ority of modularization in efciency. Table 2 summarizes the recent work that addresses the efciency of introducing neuronal diversity.

Due to the spatiotemporal information processing abil‑ ity, spiking neurons are highly energy-efcient. Unlike the conventional neuron that keeps the working status all the time, the spiking neuron idles unless it receives a spike from some events.

#### **Memory**

The reason why a connectionist model sufers catastrophic forgetting is that training such a model for a new task cata‑ strophically interferes with the knowledge amassed in the previous task. In contrast, although humans tend to gradu‑ ally forget previous information as getting old, learning new knowledge while catastrophically forgetting old knowledge rarely happens. Achieving lifelong learning is difficult because of the stability-plasticity dilemma: the model has to maintain both plasticity to acquire new knowledge and sta‑ bility to prevent the consolidated knowledge from being dis‑ mantled. Roughly, three types of computational approaches have been proposed to address the catastrophic forgetting [170]: i) imposing constraints on the level of plasticity to protect the consolidated knowledge [171]; ii) allocating additional neural resources for new tasks [172]; iii) using two complementary learning systems dedicated to learning new information and replaying old experiences, respectively [173]. Inspired by the second type of approaches, we fnd that polynomial neurons can ofer a novel view to achieve lifelong learning by enabling a network to be internally pro‑ gressive. Thus, the knowledge of old tasks is stored instead of destroyed when facing new tasks. As shown in Fig. 5(a), traditionally, given a new task, a new sub-network is cre‑ ated, and lateral links with the old tasks are learned. We refer to such a network as an externally progressive net‑ work. In contrast, assuming a polynomial neuron is used, as Fig. 5(b), tensor decomposition is doable to rearrange a polynomial neuron [119] into an internally compositional structure which encodes knowledge of a sequence of tasks into a hierarchy. Retaining old terms and adding new terms provides fexibility to balance old knowledge and the new. The internally progressive mechanism may apply to situa‑ tions where new tasks and old tasks are somewhat relevant.

#### **Interpretability**

One way to derive an interpretation from a model is to under‑ stand its components, as the entire complex system can be usually decomposed into a combination of many functional modules [174]. For example, Bau et al. [175] analyzed a CNN trained on the scene classifcation task and discovered via the receptive feld analyses that each neuron matches certain object concepts. In the same vein, an exciting point about a polynomial neuron or other nonlinear neurons is that the neuron per se contains an internal attention mechanism. The following derivation shows how to cast the attention mechanism from a quadratic neuron [176]:

(11) ( ( *x⊤wr* + *br* )(*x⊤wg* + *bg* ) + (*x ⊙ x*) *⊤wb* + *c*) = (*x⊤wg* ( *x⊤wr* + *br* ) + *bgx⊤wr* + *bgbr* + (*x ⊙ x*) *⊤wb*) = (*x⊤*( *wg* ( *x⊤wr* + *br* )) + *x⊤wr bg* + *x⊤*(*x ⊙ wb*)) = (*x⊤*(*x ⊙ wb* + *wgx⊤wr* + *wgbr* + *wr bg*)),

where *x ⊙ wb* + *wgx⊤wr* can refect where a neuron deems as important regions, in analogy to the attention mechanism.

Furthermore, in this light, all neurons with a nonlinear aggregation function are self-explanatory. Suppose that a neuron is *𝜎*(*g*(*x*)), we conduct the Taylor expansion around 0 for *g*(*x*) and remove the third and higher-order terms:

$$\sigma(g(x))$$
 
$$=\sigma(g(0)+x^{\top}Dg(0)+x^{\top}Hg(0)x)\tag{12}$$
 
$$=\sigma\big{(}g(0)+x^{\top}(Dg(0)+Hg(0)x)\big{)},$$

 where *Dg*(0) is the partial derivative of *g*(*x*) at zero, and *Hg*(0) is the Hessian matrix of *g*(*x*) at zero. Clearly, the mainstream neuron type (*x⊤w* + *b*) does not enjoy such a kind of self-interpretability, which necessitates the involve‑ ment of new type of neurons in artifcial networks for better interpretability.

## **Representative applications**

Since introducing neuronal diversity is a fundamental change instead of a slight modifcation for a neural network, it has a global impact on the research and development of artifcial networks, with the promise of pushing a wide spec‑ trum of applications. Here, we discuss representative realworld applications in diferent important felds to illustrate the practical value of introducing neuronal diversity.

## **Medical imaging**

X-ray computed tomography (CT) is one of the most popular and important imaging modalities in hospitals and clinics. Although CT can ofer critical clinical information, patients have to bear potential risks because X-rays may cause genetic changes and cancer [177]. Therefore, reducing the radiation dose is an important problem in the CT feld. How‑ ever, images reconstructed from the lower dose sufer from noise and other kinds of artifacts. In clinics, noise removal, texture preservation, and structure fdelity are three key aspects concerning radiologists. Algorithms should achieve a reasonable balance between these three aspects for a better clinical diagnosis.

Autoencoders [178] are a class of networks that consist of encoding and decoding parts. The encoding part attempts to learn a new representation, and the decoding part regener‑ ates the input from the learned representation. In [179], a quadratic autoencoder (Q-AE) was proposed to process the low-dose CT images, in hope that the quality of processed images can reach the level of images reconstructed from the normal-dose CT. This Q-AE model employs ReLU as activa‑ tion functions for all neurons, and has 5 quadratic convolu‑ tional layers in the encoding and 5 quadratic deconvolutional layers in the decoding, where each layer has 15 quadratic fl‑ ters of 5 × 5, and symmetric layers are aggregated by resid‑ ual connections. The anonymous reader study on the Mayo low-dose CT dataset revealed the superior performance of the quadratic autoencoder in terms of image denoising and model efciency than other state-of-the-art models.

#### **Industrial informatics**

The bearing faults are the most common source of faults in rotating machines such as wind turbines and aircraft engines [180]. To enhance the reliability of rotating machines and avoid economic loss, accurately diagnosing bearing faults is of great importance. Currently, a common and viable diagnosis method is to frst measure vibration signals by attaching the measurement instrument to the rotating bearing [181], and then use an artifcial network to classify the faulty signals from the normal. Despite great successes in bearing fault detection, artifcial networks lack interpretability, *i.e*., it is hard to know if the model conforms to the physics prin‑ ciple when classifying fault signals out.

A convolutional neural network made of quadratic neu‑ rons (QCNN) was proposed for bearing fault diagnosis [176]. With the qttention mechanism derived earlier, the feature extraction process of QCNN and the physics princi‑ ple explaining why the model can deliver good classifca‑ tion performance are deciphered to a large extent. For exam‑ ple, by visualizing faulty bearing signals and the qttention maps, it was found that all the faulty areas were captured by QCNN. By comparing the raw signal and the qttention map in the frequency domain, it was discovered that QCNN favors bearing fault frequency elements over the shaft fre‑ quency elements.

#### **Numerical computing**

A general form of a non-linear partial diferential equation (PDE) can be expressed as *f*(*u*, *𝛾*) = 0, where *f* is a nonlinear operator performed on partial derivatives of the target variable *u*, and *𝛾* represents the parameters of the PDE. In the realm of PDEs and numerical computing, two classes of problems are mainly concerned: (a) forward problems, which are to solve for the target variable u prescribed by the PDE, and (b) inverse problems, which involve learning the unknown parameters, *𝛾*, of the PDE, given the observations of *u* at diferent timestamps.

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a type of neural networks that consider the physical laws and prior knowledge governing the problem in model design and train‑ ing [182]. The prior knowledge of general physical laws is in the form of PDEs, and can be employed as a regularization for the training of a network, *e.g*., formulating the PDE equa‑ tion into a supervised loss function. Motivated by the non‑ linear approximation ability of quadratic networks, Bu et al. [128] proposed a quadratic residual network to solve the forward and inverse problems in PDEs. Following the origi‑ nal PINN framework, empirical results demonstrated that QResNet exhibits consistent advantages over conventional networks in terms of parameter efciency and approximation accuracy. Let us take the Allen–Cahn equation [183] as an example to show why QResNet fts. The task is to predict *u* based on the PDE as follows:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-0.0001\cdot\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+5u^{3}-5u=0,\tag{13}$$

and the initial condition. Discretizing this equation leads to

$$u_{t+1}=u_{t}+0.0001\cdot\frac{\partial^{2}u_{t}}{\partial x^{2}}-5u_{t}^{3}-5u_{t}.\tag{14}$$

Since the right-hand side of Eq. 14 consists of a polyno‑ mial function regarding *ut* . Therefore, it is more suitable to use a quadratic neuron to learn it than a conventional neuron. Moreover, Eq. 14 contains a residual relation, which well fts a residual network.

#### **Computer vision**

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary feld that enables a computer to derive a meaningful understanding from digi‑ tal images, videos, or other visual inputs [184]. Computer vision tasks concern acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital inputs such as image restoration, face recognition, and video tracking. Neural network models have been dominating computer vision since the tremendous suc‑ cess in classifying approximately 1.2 million images into 1,000 classes in the ImageNet challenge [16]. As a drop-in replacement, polynomial networks [119] have been applied to a plethora of computer vision tasks. It was empirically demonstrated that the polynomial networks produce com‑ petitive results in a large variety of computer vision tasks such as image recognition, face recognition, and image generation.

## **Challenges and outlooks**

#### **Neuronal synergy**

To unleash the potential of neuronal diversity, the core prob‑ lem is how to make diferent neurons synergize together to maximize their strengths, as Fig. 6 shows. In the human brain, the activities of a large number of neurons are well coordinated. For example, parallel activities of neurons are observed to lie in a low-dimensional manifold [185, 186]. Although the underlying coordination mechanism remains unclear, we know that the coordination of difer‑ ent neurons in the brain is highly artful and efcient, *e.g*.,

**Fig. 6** Diferent neurons should be synergized together to maxi‑ mize their strengths. Despite the diversity, neurons have several basic types (denoted by various shapes), and each type of neu‑ rons have similar but slightly diferent variants (denoted by various colors)

the coordination of distant neurons is enabled not only via long-range connections but also through heterogeneity in local connectivity [187]. Generally speaking, the learning of an artifcial network is governed by the loss function and the optimization algorithm. There is no explicit algorithm suggesting how to synergize diferent types of neurons for the same task. Inspired by neural architecture search [188], a brute-force means to accommodate this problem is neuronal cell search, which takes the neuronal type as the model's hyperparameters to optimize in the framework of AutoML [189]. However, it is more desirable if neuroscience fndings can shed light on some rule-of-thumb or useful inductive bias to guide neuronal synergy. For example, in the popula‑ tion coding theory, the collective responses of a population of neurons are to maximize the amount of information [190].

#### **Task‑based neuron design**

The past 10 years have witnessed a surge of many out‑ standing architectures, such as U-Net [191], the pyramidal structure [192], and shortcuts [1, 193]. The central princi‑ ple behind these studies is designing a network architecture according to the needs of a task. In light of neuronal diver‑ sity, the neuronal type is also critical to the power of a neu‑ ral network. Thus, we ask the following question: Can the network design go from the task-based architecture design to the task-based neuron design? Our brain is exactly a taskbased neuron designer, *i.e*., biological neurons have abun‑ dant functional diversity, which is a necessity for the brain to execute diferent tasks. The advantage of the task-based neuron design over the task-based architecture design is that task-specifc neurons contain useful implicit bias for the task. Thus, the network of these task-specifc neurons can integrate the task-driven forces of all these neurons, which should be much stronger than the network of generic neurons with the same structure. Our conjecture is that the task-based neuron design will escalate neural network research into a new stage and make advances in many previously-believed

difcult tasks. Figures 7 and 8 showcases a three-step road‑ map for the task-based neuron design:

- 1) Build an elementary neuronal model via symbolic regression. Encouraged by the concept of linear regres‑ sion or polynomial regression, symbolic regression [194] is to search over the space of all possible math‑ ematical formulas regarding the input variables, starting from base functions such as logarithmic, trigonomet‑ ric, and exponential functions. Furthermore, the search space should be regularized to entitle the established neuron with the desirable properties, *e.g*., no gradient vanishment or explosion when connected to a network. For example, we can split the search space into two parts: the aggregation function and the activation func‑ tion.
- 2) Parameterize the learned elementary neuron to make its parameters trainable. Such a parameterization can be straightforwardly made by casting all coefcients in the

elementary neuron as learnable parameters. However, for better efciency and expressivity, selecting which coefcients to parameterize can be optimized based on the fnal performance.

- 3) Employ task-based neurons in a network for validation and feedback. For example, according to the perfor‑ mance of the network, some base formulas in a taskbased neuron might be pruned. Task-based neurons can also facilitate multi-task learning. With increasingly many task-based neurons designed, a warehouse of neu‑ rons can be gradually established in which a knowledge graph and neuron-based informatics could be developed.
## **Theoretical issues**

Since the rise in 2012, deep learning has been criticized for lacking a fundamental theory. This embarrassment Med-X (2025) 3:2 2 Page 16 of 21

**Table 3** A resource summary for neuronal diversity in artifcial networks

has been greatly alleviated in recent years with the rapid development of deep learning theory. Expressivity-wise, why a deep network performs superbly [195, 196] is well addressed by characterizing the complexity of a function expressed by a neural network, *i.e*., increasing depth can greatly maximize such a complexity measure compared to increasing width; the power of shortcuts are demonstrated as well [1], *i.e*., a network with shortcuts can express a far more complicated network than a network without short‑ cuts. Optimization-wise, the neural tangent kernel theory suggests that the training of an infnitely wide network is equivalent to a kernel ridge regression [197]. The under‑ standing of the generalization ability of deep networks is also deepened by the discovery of the double descent phenomenon [198].

Notwithstanding, the existing theory provides an explanation for the simplest neuron that is based on an inner product and an activation function, which may not be applicable to other kinds of nonlinear neurons. In the context of neuronal diversity, we ask the follow‑ ing question for theorists to brainstorm: to what extent are the current theories scalable to heterogeneous net‑ works? Addressing this question is highly nontrivial in two senses. On the one hand, the philosophy behind homogeneous and heterogeneous networks varies greatly. The former implicitly assumes that a universal type of neurons can solve a wide class of complicated nonlinear problems, simply referred to as "one-for-all". Such a phi‑ losophy is well supported by the universal approximation theorem [199]. However, the problem of this philosophy is practicality and efficiency, *i.e*., it may suffer the curse of dimensionality. In contrast, the latter assumes differ‑ ent types of neurons solve a specific problem, which is referred to as "all-for-one". The loss of universality in heterogeneous networks adds a layer of complication to the theoretical analyses. The low-hanging fruits may come from the efficiency analysis first by showing that the mode of "all-for-one" is more efficient than that of "one-for-all". Then, the optimization and generalization properties can be further analyzed.

## **Neuroinformatics of artifcial neurons and networks**

Neuroinformatics is an interdisciplinary feld that introduces informatics into neuroscience for data mining and informa‑ tion processing. With the large-scale deployment of those task-specifc neurons into networks, methodologically, we think it is highly necessary to introduce tools of informatics into artifcial neurons and networks to further extract infor‑ mation from diferent neurons and networks, referred to as neuroinformatics of artifcial neurons. The goals of this kind of neuroinformatics are to make contributions to the next generation of AI by drawing insights into the information processing of biological networks, supporting brain-inspired intelligence, and fertilizing the interpretability of artifcial networks. To realize this goal, on the one hand, tools for analyzing and standardizing artifcial neurons and networks should be developed; on the other hand, the database and knowledge graph can be built for various artifcial neurons to supply ontology information about neuron ftness and rela‑ tions between diferent neurons, to advance the connectivity organization, and to instruct the multi-module synergy.

#### **Remark**

Future research should particularly emphasize the identifca‑ tion of impactful applications of neuronal diversity or lever‑ age this concept to address real-world challenges, thereby enhancing the relevance and success of neuronal diversity. Additionally, in light of the remarkable achievements of large language models, there is a pressing need to develop a large model that incorporates diverse types of neurons. Such a model could be computationally efcient, promoting widespread adoption in resource-constrained environments, owing to the robust representational capabilities of innova‑ tive neurons at a fundamental level.

# **Resource summary**

We list the useful resources about neuronal diversity in Table 3 for readers' reference.

# **Conclusions**

In this perspective, we have systematically introduced neuronal diversity into artifcial networks, as a practice of NeuroAI, including biological background, the existing studies, chal‑ lenges, and future directions. We believe that neuronal diversity, the insight from NeuroAI, has the potential of elevating artif‑ cial networks into a new age. Future eforts can be invested to demonstrate more and more killer applications of new neurons.
